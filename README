Getting all the NetLogo embedding stuff required some major changes to MainWindow class:
	It is now a singleton. This was done because of the way NetLogo lite api handles command passing.
	Minor changes were made to the main method to prevent concurrency errors when writing commands to NetLogo.
	Changes were made to the initComponents() method. 
		WARNING: Regenerating the MainWindow UI codes with NetBeans will break the embedding.
	     
All the object classes were changed to work with the new command calls.
